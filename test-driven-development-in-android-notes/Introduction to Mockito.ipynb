    "Sometimes the object under test has to collaborate with another one. Because you want to focus on the first object, in the configuration phase, you want to provide a test double collaborator to your object under test. This fake collaborator is just for testing purposes and you configure it to behave as you want. For example, you could make a mock so that calling a method on it always returns the same hardcoded String. This is called stubbing a method. You'll use Mockito for this."
