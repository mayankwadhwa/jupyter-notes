    "\n",
    "To understand why architecture matters, it's essential first to understand what qualifies as a poorly architected app.\n",
    "\n",
    "A poorly architected app may have all of its logic contained within a single method that consists of many lines; or it may have one large class with too many responsibilities. Both of these scenarios make it impossible to test groups or units of logic independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Apps that are architected for testing separate their code into groups of logic using multiple methods and classes to collaborate. With this type of architecture, developers can test each public method and class in isolation.\n"

    "* **Reusable abstraction**: Reusability saves time. Later in the chapter, you’ll see that you can reuse patterns within different parts of an app, across different apps as well as on other platforms. You’ll also see that you can use architecture patterns to kick-off new projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Early design decisions**: When you create a new app, one of the first decisions is to decide on the architecture you’re going to use. These early design decisions are important because they’ll set constraints on your implementation, such as the way your classes will interact and their responsibilities. Early decisions will also organize your codebase a specific way and may even organize the members of your team. For example, on a given architecture, you may divide your team between people who only write domain classes and others who only write visually related code.\n",

    "The **Adapter** design pattern describes how to let two incompatible classes work together\n",
    "\n",

    "* **Presenter**: Similar to the Controller from the previous pattern, the Presenter retrieves data from the Model and updates it accordingly. It has UI presentation logic that decides what to display. It notifies the View when a Model has changed. Therefore, it has a reference to the View and the Model.\n",

    "Differences between the MVC and MVP patterns are that in MVP, the View doesn’t have a direct reference to the Model, meaning it is loosely-coupled. Instead, the Presenter brings the transformed or simplified Model, ready to be displayed to the View. MVP also proposes that the Presenter should handle everything related to the presentation of the View. In MVC, it's not clear where the UI logic should be, compared to MVP where it’s common to put it in the Presenter. Because of this, the Presenter could grow a lot, converting it into another anti-pattern called God-class (you’ll learn more about this concept later). It’s a good practice to create small classes (e.g. an AddressFormatter) with single responsibilities to have better maintainability and unit testing. These collaborator objects could be injected in the constructor, as explained before.\n",

    "\n",

If the new tests are not related or don’t follow the essence of the existing ones, the functionality violates SRP. For example, think of a Car class that has an associated test class that check the methods startEngine(), accelerate(), stopEngine(). Suppose you need a new feature that drives the car to a place. You may be tempted to open the existing test suite, and write a new test like testDriveToPlace() that would check a new method driveToPlace() of the Car class.

As you can see, if you respect the contract, the app should continue to work.\n",

Suppose you have a class with a few methods, one part of your app may only need to access a subset of your methods and other part may need to access another subset. This principle encourages you to create two interfaces. Clients should have access to only what they need and nothing more.\n",

    "}\n",

    "Now, when you create the Presenter, you can still pass the ApiDataFetcher as a parameter. However, the presenter doesn’t know about it, it just depends on an abstraction, the DataFetcher interface. So it will be easy to change it to a SharedPreferencesDataFetcher or a RoomDataFetcher class as long as those classes implement the DataFetcher interface.\n"
