    "\n",
    "To understand why architecture matters, it's essential first to understand what qualifies as a poorly architected app.\n",
    "\n",
    "A poorly architected app may have all of its logic contained within a single method that consists of many lines; or it may have one large class with too many responsibilities. Both of these scenarios make it impossible to test groups or units of logic independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Apps that are architected for testing separate their code into groups of logic using multiple methods and classes to collaborate. With this type of architecture, developers can test each public method and class in isolation.\n"

    "\n",
    "* **Reusable abstraction**: Reusability saves time. Later in the chapter, you’ll see that you can reuse patterns within different parts of an app, across different apps as well as on other platforms. You’ll also see that you can use architecture patterns to kick-off new projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Early design decisions**: When you create a new app, one of the first decisions is to decide on the architecture you’re going to use. These early design decisions are important because they’ll set constraints on your implementation, such as the way your classes will interact and their responsibilities. Early decisions will also organize your codebase a specific way and may even organize the members of your team. For example, on a given architecture, you may divide your team between people who only write domain classes and others who only write visually related code.\n",

    "\n",
    "We can solve this problem by dependency injection which states that the collaborators are provided to an object that requires them.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### There are two ways to inject dependencies\n",
    "    * Construction Injection\n",
    "``` kotlin\n",

    "### Adapter or Wrapper Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Adapter** design pattern describes how to let two incompatible classes work together\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in Android, when you have a list of contacts that you want to show in a RecyclerView, the RecyclerView doesn’t know how to show objects of the class Contact. That’s why you need to use a ContactsAdapter class\n",
    "\n",
    "### Facade Pattern\n",

    "class ProductsRepository {\n",

    "### Observer Design Pattern\n",

    "\n",
    "* **Presenter**: Similar to the Controller from the previous pattern, the Presenter retrieves data from the Model and updates it accordingly. It has UI presentation logic that decides what to display. It notifies the View when a Model has changed. Therefore, it has a reference to the View and the Model.\n",

    "<img src=\"resources/mvp-1.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"500\"/>\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Differences between the MVC and MVP patterns are that in MVP, the View doesn’t have a direct reference to the Model, meaning it is loosely-coupled. Instead, the Presenter brings the transformed or simplified Model, ready to be displayed to the View. MVP also proposes that the Presenter should handle everything related to the presentation of the View. In MVC, it's not clear where the UI logic should be, compared to MVP where it’s common to put it in the Presenter. Because of this, the Presenter could grow a lot, converting it into another anti-pattern called God-class (you’ll learn more about this concept later). It’s a good practice to create small classes (e.g. an AddressFormatter) with single responsibilities to have better maintainability and unit testing. These collaborator objects could be injected in the constructor, as explained before.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the Presenter talks to a View interface, in production code the Activities, Fragments and custom views implement that interface. But, in your tests, instead of using those Android classes, you could create custom classes that implement the View interfaces and assert that the corresponding methods were called.\n",
