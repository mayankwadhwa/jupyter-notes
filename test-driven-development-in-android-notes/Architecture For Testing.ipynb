    "## How does architecture matter?\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand why architecture matters, it's essential first to understand what qualifies as a poorly architected app.\n",
    "\n",
    "A poorly architected app may have all of its logic contained within a single method that consists of many lines; or it may have one large class with too many responsibilities. Both of these scenarios make it impossible to test groups or units of logic independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Apps that are architected for testing separate their code into groups of logic using multiple methods and classes to collaborate. With this type of architecture, developers can test each public method and class in isolation.\n"

    "* **Communication**: Software architecture establishes a common language between the developers of an app and other members of the team, like managers, QA testers, analysts and designers.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Reusable abstraction**: Reusability saves time. Later in the chapter, you’ll see that you can reuse patterns within different parts of an app, across different apps as well as on other platforms. You’ll also see that you can use architecture patterns to kick-off new projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Early design decisions**: When you create a new app, one of the first decisions is to decide on the architecture you’re going to use. These early design decisions are important because they’ll set constraints on your implementation, such as the way your classes will interact and their responsibilities. Early decisions will also organize your codebase a specific way and may even organize the members of your team. For example, on a given architecture, you may divide your team between people who only write domain classes and others who only write visually related code.\n",

    "\n",
    "It's not uncommon for developers to encounter the same problems in different projects and platforms, and to solve these problems using similar solutions. Over time, certain developers started formalizing these patterns into templates or solutions that other developers could reuse if they found themselves in a similar context or situation.\n",

    "  ...\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The vehicle class itself intialize the CombustionEngine() object which makes it difficult to test Vehicle class when something happens with the engine object for example it brakes etc\n",
    "\n",
    "And if we want to use different type of engine such as electric engine.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can solve this problem by dependency injection which states that the collaborators are provided to an object that requires them.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### There are two ways to inject dependencies\n",
    "    * Construction Injection\n",
    "``` kotlin\n",
    "    class Vehicle(val engine: Engine) {\n",
    "      fun start(): Boolean {\n",

    "## Structural Design Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "Structural design patterns ease the design to establish relationship between objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adapter or Wrapper Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Adapter** design pattern describes how to let two incompatible classes work together\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in Android, when you have a list of contacts that you want to show in a RecyclerView, the RecyclerView doesn’t know how to show objects of the class Contact. That’s why you need to use a ContactsAdapter class\n",
    "\n",
    "### Facade Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Facade design pattern** defines a high-level interface objects which hides the complexity of the underlying objects.\n",

    "class ProductsRepository {\n",

    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example, getProducts() grabs the data from a remote server, memory, filesystem, or maybe SharedPreferences or Room. It’s easier to use ProductsRepository, which abstracts getting the products from the corresponding source.\n",

While creational pattern explains a specific moment of time (the creation of an instance), and structural pattern describes a static structure, behavioral pattern describes the dynamic flow.\n",

    "### Observer Design Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Observer Design Pattern** gives a way to communicate between the object where one object informs other about changes and action. There's an **Observable Object** which we can observe and there's one or more observer object which can be used to subscribe to the observable.\n",

    "\n",
    "A concrete command object knows about the receiver and invokes a method of the receiver. When an invoker calls the execute method of the command object, the command is delegated to the receiver. The invoker only knows about the command interface.\n",
