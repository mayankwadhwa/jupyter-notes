It analyzes the execution of your code and inlines calls whenever doing so provides the most benefit. This happens automatically and at the machine-code level.

What’s more, the stacktrace is clearer if the function is called directly.\n",

    "On the other hand, inlining functions with lambda parameters is beneficial. First, the overhead you avoid through inlining is more significant. You save not only on the call, but also on the creation of the extra class for each lambda and an object for the lambda instance. Second, the JVM currently isn’t smart enough to always perform inlining through the call and lambda.
